# Twin identification with connectome fingerprinting

This repository contains all source code necessary to replicate our recent work entitled "Inferring the heritability of 
large-scale functional networks with a multivariate ACE modeling approach" available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/437335v2.full).


## General information

Connectome fingerprint script are all available at ./src and figures were generated with scripts at ./plots. 
## Requirements

All packages necessary to replicate the analyses are listed at requirements.txt.

## Citation

Please cite our paper if you use our model (available at https://github.com/frcsantos/heritability) or if it was somewhat 
useful for you.
